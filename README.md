This is a project for building a text editor that runs in the browser. The application is designed as a single-page application that fulfills the criteria of a Progressive Web Application (PWA). It incorporates various data persistence techniques to ensure offline functionality. The key aspect of the application is implementing methods to store and retrieve data using an IndexedDB database. To achieve this, the `idb` package is utilized.
